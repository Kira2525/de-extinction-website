      <h1>Future Conservation Initiative</h1>

      <p>
        Future Conservation Initiative is a nonprofit organization focused on exploring scientific
        innovation responsibly. Our mission is to examine emerging technologies like de-extinction
        while making sure ecosystems, animal welfare, and ethical responsibility remain the top
        priorities.
      </p>

      <p>
        While new genetic technologies may offer exciting possibilities, our organization believes
        that science should move forward with caution. We support research that aims to repair damage
        caused by humans, but only when it can be done without creating new risks for animals or the
        environment.
      </p>

      <h3>Our Goals</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Promote ethical scientific research and responsible innovation</li>
        <li>Educate the public on de-extinction using accurate, accessible information</li>
        <li>Encourage transparency in scientific research</li>
        <li>Support conservation efforts that protect endangered species</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Future Conservation Initiative also works to raise awareness about the importance of protecting
        species that are currently at risk of extinction. We believe that conservation should always
        come first, and that de-extinction should never replace efforts to protect living ecosystems.
      </p>

      <p>
        By combining education, research, and ethical discussion, our organization aims to help the
        public better understand both the potential benefits and serious concerns surrounding
        de-extinction.
