            <h3>Our Mission</h3>
            <p>The Revival Project is a research and education organization dedicated to exploring the science, ethics, and implications of de-extinction technology. We believe that informed public discussion is essential as this technology continues to develop.</p>

            <h3>What We Do</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Research:</strong> We analyze current de-extinction projects and assess their feasibility, risks, and potential benefits</li>
                <li><strong>Education:</strong> We provide accessible information to help people understand the complex issues surrounding de-extinction</li>
                <li><strong>Advocacy:</strong> We promote responsible policies and ethical guidelines for de-extinction research</li>
                <li><strong>Conservation Focus:</strong> We emphasize the importance of protecting endangered species before pursuing de-extinction</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Our Goals</h3>
            <div class="two-column">
                <div>
                    <h4>Short-Term Goals:</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Educate the public about de-extinction technology</li>
                        <li>Promote transparency in de-extinction research</li>
                        <li>Encourage ethical discussions among scientists and policymakers</li>
                        <li>Support conservation efforts for currently endangered species</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h4>Long-Term Goals:</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Help develop comprehensive legal frameworks for de-extinction</li>
                        <li>Ensure animal welfare is prioritized in all projects</li>
                        <li>Advocate for ecosystem impact studies before any releases</li>
                        <li>Bridge the gap between scientific possibility and ethical responsibility</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
            </div>

            <div class="highlight-box">
                <h3>Our Position</h3>
                <p>We recognize that de-extinction technology is advancing rapidly, and while it offers exciting possibilities, we believe it must be approached with extreme caution. Our organization advocates for:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Prioritizing living endangered species over extinct ones</li>
                    <li>Comprehensive legal protections before any de-extinction attempts</li>
                    <li>Long-term studies in controlled environments</li>
                    <li>Public involvement in decision-making processes</li>
                    <li>Ethical consideration of animal welfare above scientific curiosity</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <h3>Why This Matters</h3>
            <p>De-extinction isn't just a science fiction concept anymore - it's becoming reality. As we stand on the edge of potentially bringing back extinct species, we need to ask ourselves the hard questions:</p>
            
            <ul>
                <li>Just because we can, should we?</li>
                <li>What responsibility do we have to these animals?</li>
                <li>How will this affect the species we still have?</li>
                <li>Who benefits, and who pays the price?</li>
            </ul>

            <p>These are the questions The Revival Project exists to explore. We believe that everyone should have access to accurate information about this technology so they can form their own opinions and participate in these important discussions.</p>

            <h3>Get Involved</h3>
            <p>While The Revival Project is an educational organization created for this research project, the questions we're exploring are very real. If you're interested in conservation and de-extinction:</p>
            
            <ul>
                <li>Support conservation organizations working to protect endangered species</li>
                <li>Stay informed about developments in genetic technology</li>
                <li>Engage in conversations about the ethics of de-extinction</li>
                <li>Advocate for strong legal protections for all animals</li>
                <li>Consider the long-term consequences of our choices</li>
            </ul>

            <p>The future of our planet's biodiversity is in our hands. Let's make sure we handle it responsibly.</p>
