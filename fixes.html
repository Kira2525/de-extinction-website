      <h1>Short- and Long-Term Fixes</h1>

      <p>
        While de-extinction has the potential to help repair damaged ecosystems, it also comes with serious risks.
        Because of this, scientists need clear plans in place to make sure the animals and the environment are
        protected before any species is revived or released.
      </p>

      <h3>Short-Term Solutions</h3>
      <p>
        One short-term solution is to keep any revived species in controlled environments. This allows scientists
        to closely monitor the animals’ health, behavior, and ability to survive without immediately putting
        modern ecosystems at risk.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Keep revived species in controlled or protected environments</li>
        <li>Study health issues caused by missing or altered DNA</li>
        <li>Prevent early release into ecosystems that may not support them</li>
        <li>Be transparent with the public about both failures and successes</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Sharing accurate information with the public can help reduce misinformation and allow people to better
        understand both the benefits and dangers of de-extinction.
      </p>

      <h3>Long-Term Solutions</h3>
      <p>
        Long-term solutions focus on creating rules and priorities that ensure de-extinction is handled responsibly.
        Without proper laws and ethical guidelines, revived species could be mistreated or misused.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Create strict government regulations that define how revived species are protected</li>
        <li>Develop ethical guidelines to prevent unnecessary suffering</li>
        <li>Clarify legal responsibility if something goes wrong</li>
        <li>Prioritize protecting endangered species that are still alive today</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Many people argue that funding should first go toward saving species that are currently at risk of extinction.
        If existing species are not protected, de-extinction efforts may become pointless as more animals disappear.
      </p>

      <p>
        If de-extinction is done carefully, slowly, and with strong oversight, it could become a useful tool for
        conservation. However, the welfare of the animals must always come first, because bringing back a species
        means nothing if it cannot live a healthy and safe life.
