            <h2>The History of De-Extinction</h2>

            <h3>It Started with Dolly</h3>
            <p>The idea of de-extinction has been discussed for years, but before scientists could attempt to bring back any extinct animal, they first had to achieve success with cloning technology. The first real success came in 1996 when researchers cloned Dolly the sheep, the first mammal ever cloned from an adult cell.</p>

            <div class="image-placeholder">
                [Image: Dolly the Sheep - The first cloned mammal]
            </div>

            <p>They had finally realized that they could copy the DNA of a living animal and create the exact same replica of that animal. However, Beth Shapiro points out that it may never be possible to create an identical living copy of an extinct species, and any recreated animals would be "ecological proxies" rather than perfect replicas of their extinct species.</p>

            <div class="warning-box">
                <strong>Important Note:</strong> Dolly lived for six and a half years before dying from a lung disease in 2003. This brought up questions about the long term effects that cloning could have on cloned animals.
            </div>

            <h3>The First De-Extinction Attempt</h3>
            <p>Not long after Dolly, researchers attempted the first de-extinction experiment. In 2003, scientists cloned a Pyrenean ibex also known as the bucardo, a mountain goat species that had gone extinct in 2000.</p>

            <div class="two-column">
                <div>
                    <p>This was the first time that an extinct animal had ever been brought back, even though it did not live very long. The ibex was born alive but died a few minutes after it was born due to a lung defect that prevented it from breathing.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="image-container">

</div>

            </div>

            <p>Even though the cloning worked, it made scientists realize the risks that could happen. The ibex's death brought up concerns about genetic gaps, health problems and whether revived animals would even be able to survive.</p>

            <h3>Going Public: The TED Talk That Changed Everything</h3>
            <p>In 2013, Stewart Brand spoke at a TED Talk to introduce the public to the possibilities and the potential benefits of bringing back extinct species. Brand said that if humans played a role in wiping out certain animals, then using modern genetic tools might help fix some of the damage that was done.</p>

            <p>Brand's talk increased support for using genetics to correct past extinctions caused by humans. His presentation encouraged more people to see de-extinction as a positive thing and sparked conversations across the world.</p>

            <h3>The Game-Changer: CRISPR</h3>
            <p>In 2017, scientists started using a gene-editing tool called CRISPR, and this was a major development. This powerful tool allowed DNA to be edited in a new and better way that they never could do before.</p>

            <div class="highlight-box">
                <p><strong>What CRISPR Does:</strong> CRISPR can be used to engineer traits from extinct species and insert them into the genomes of living relatives. Because of this, CRISPR became one of the most important tools in bringing back extinct species.</p>
            </div>

            <h3>Recent Developments</h3>
            
            <p><strong>2022 - The Tasmanian Tiger Project:</strong> Researchers announced their plan to bring back the Tasmanian tiger, also known as the thylacine. The thylacine was last seen alive in 1936, which makes it one of the more recent extinctions, meaning that there is still good DNA available to work with.</p>

            <div class="image-placeholder">

            </div>

            <p><strong>2023 - The Woolly Mammoth Project:</strong> Scientists officially launched the Woolly Mammoth Project. For years scientists were talking about this project, but now with having more advanced technology like CRISPR, they started putting a plan together to make that happen. Researchers now predict the woolly mammoth could possibly return by 2028 if the science continues to move this fast.</p>

            <p><strong>2025 - The Dire Wolf Controversy:</strong> Scientists announced that they had successfully brought back the dire wolf by using genes from a gray wolf and from domestic dogs. But as soon as the news came out, people started arguing about whether these animals were true dire wolves. Many people said the revived wolves weren't the real thing, explaining that they were actually "genetically modified gray wolves" instead of genuine dire wolves.</p>
