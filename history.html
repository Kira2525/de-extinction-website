      <h1>History of De-Extinction</h1>

      <p>
        The idea of de-extinction has been discussed for years, but it did not become realistic until scientists
        made major breakthroughs in cloning and genetic technology. The first major success came in 1996 with
        the cloning of Dolly the sheep.
      </p>

      <p>
        Dolly proved that DNA from an adult cell could be copied to create a living animal. While this was a
        huge scientific achievement, her early death also raised concerns about the long-term health effects
        of cloning.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>1996:</strong> Dolly the Sheep is successfully cloned</li>
        <li><strong>2003:</strong> Pyrenean ibex is cloned but dies shortly after birth</li>
        <li><strong>2013:</strong> Stewart Brand introduces de-extinction to the public through a TED Talk</li>
        <li><strong>2010s:</strong> CRISPR gene-editing technology advances and expands de-extinction research</li>
        <li><strong>2023:</strong> Woolly Mammoth Project is officially launched</li>
      </ul>

      <br>

      <p>
        Later attempts, such as the cloning of the Pyrenean ibex, showed that even when cloning works,
        serious risks remain. These early experiments made scientists realize that de-extinction would
        require more research, better technology, and careful planning.
      </p>

      <h2>Growth of De-Extinction Technology</h2>
      <p>
        As technology improved, especially with the development of CRISPR, scientists gained new tools
        that made editing DNA faster and more precise. This opened the door for projects like the woolly
        mammoth and the thylacine.

        This timeline shows how de-extinction slowly developed over time, with each scientific breakthrough
        bringing researchers closer to the possibility of reviving extinct species.
