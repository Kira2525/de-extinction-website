            <h2>Bringing Back The Past</h2>
            
            <p>Can you imagine living among the same species that once roamed the Earth during the Ice Age? Scientists are getting closer to making that happen through a process called de-extinction, which focuses on reviving extinct species. This may sound exciting, but it raises some serious questions that we need to think about.</p>

</div>

            <p>Supporters believe the new genetic technology could help restore damaged ecosystems and even repair some of the harm caused by humans over the years. Critics are worried that reviving extinct species may lead to negative consequences for the animals and the environments that they are released to.</p>

                <h3>The Big Question</h3>
                <p>Even though de-extinction is exciting and could help fix some of the damage that were caused by humans, scientists still need rules and a plan in place, because it could cause harm to the animals and the environment.</p>

            <p>The idea of de-extinction has started a debate involving environmental, ethical, and realistic concerns. This website explores both sides of the argument and looks at what needs to happen before we start bringing extinct animals back to life.</p>
