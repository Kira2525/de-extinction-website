      <h1>De-Extinction: Bringing Back the Past</h1>

      <p>De-extinction is a scientific process that focuses on reviving extinct species using advanced genetic technology. 
        The idea of seeing animals from the past walk the Earth again sounds exciting, but it also raises serious 
        ethical, environmental, and practical concerns.</p><br>

      <p>Supporters believe de-extinction could help restore damaged ecosystems and even correct some of the harm 
        caused by humans over time. Many species did not disappear naturally, but were pushed into extinction due 
        to hunting, habitat destruction, and pollution.</p><br>

      <p>
        Critics, however, worry that reviving extinct species could cause more harm than good. Recreated animals 
        may suffer from health problems, incomplete DNA, or struggle to survive in modern environments that are 
        very different from the ones they once lived in.

    <p>As scientific technology continues to improve, de-extinction has become more realistic than ever before. 
        Because of this, it has sparked an ongoing debate involving scientists, environmentalists, and the public 
        about whether bringing back extinct species is something humans should pursue.</p><br>

    <p>This website explores the history of de-extinction, the extent of the problem, the possible repercussions, 
        and both short-term and long-term solutions that could help ensure this science is handled responsibly.</p>
