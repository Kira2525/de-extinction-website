            <h2>Bringing Back The Past</h2>
            
            <div class="hero-section">
                <p>Imagine walking through a forest and coming face to face with a woolly mammoth. Or spotting a Tasmanian tiger moving through the Australian wilderness. It sounds like something straight out of science fiction, but these ideas are becoming less far-fetched by the day. Around the world, scientists are actively working to bring extinct species back to life through a process known as de-extinction.</p>

                <p class="image-caption">Woolly mammoths roamed the Earth during the Ice Age and are now a primary target for de-extinction research. Could these giants walk among us again by 2028?</p>

            <h3>A Scientific Revolution at Our Doorstep</h3>
            <p>This all sounds exciting, and in some ways it really is, but it also raises some of the biggest questions humans have ever had to face. Are we actually ready to bring back species that disappeared thousands of years ago? Do we have the right to do that? And maybe the most important question of all: should we?</p>
            
            <p>Supporters of de-extinction believe modern genetic technology could help repair damaged ecosystems and even undo some of the harm humans have caused over time. They argue that if people played a role in driving certain species to extinction through hunting, habitat destruction, and pollution, then we may have a responsibility to try to make things right. Critics, on the other hand, worry that bringing extinct species back could create serious problems for the animals themselves and for the ecosystems they would be introduced into.</p>

              <h3>The Main Question</h3>
              <p>De-extinction may be fascinating and it might even offer some benefits, but it cannot move forward without strict rules, careful planning, and strong ethical oversight. Without those protections in place, this technology could end up causing serious harm to both the animals being revived and the environments they would live in.</p>

                <p class="image-caption">Understanding why scientists pursue de-extinction helps frame the debate around this controversial technology. From ecological restoration to correcting human-caused extinctions, the motivations are complex.</p>

            <h3>What You'll Discover on This Site</h3>
            <p>This site a look at de-extinction from all sides. It covers the exciting scientific possibilities while also digging into the serious ethical and practical concerns. Everything is broken into clear sections so it’s easy to follow:</p>
            
            <div class="two-column">
              <div>
                
                <ul>
                  <li><strong>The History</strong> - Follow the path that led us here, from the cloning of Dolly the sheep in 1996 to today’s ambitious woolly mammoth projects. This section walks through the breakthroughs, setbacks, and key moments that made de-extinction possible.</li>
                  <li><strong>The Problem</strong> - Learn why bringing back extinct species is far more complicated than it sounds. From degraded DNA to genetic gaps that have to be filled using living species, the science comes with limitations.</li>
                </ul>
              
              </div>

                  <li><strong>The Repercussions</strong> - Explore what could go wrong if de-extinction isn’t handled carefully. This includes health risks for revived animals and potential disruptions to ecosystems that have evolved without them.</li>
                  <li><strong>The Solutions</strong> - Look at how de-extinction could be approached responsibly, if it’s pursued at all. This section focuses on the laws, safeguards, and ethical guidelines needed to protect animals and the environment.</li>
                </ul>
            
              </div>

            <h3>The Debate That will Change Our Future</h3>
            <p>De-extinction has started a debate about science, ethics, legal, and conservation. Some see it as a chance to fix past mistakes and restore damaged ecosystems. Others worry it’s a dangerous distraction that pulls attention and funding away from species that are struggling to survive right now.</p>
            
            <div class="info-box">
              <h4>Why This is Important</h4>
              <p>This isn’t just an abstract scientific debate happening behind closed doors. The choices being made today will change the future of biodiversity and our relationship with nature. These decisions affect everyone, which is why public understanding and involvement are Important</p>
            </div>
            
            <p>This site presents both sides of the issue honestly and in depth. You’ll find the science, the ethical concerns, and the real-world implications laid out clearly so you can decide where you stand. Whether you’re researching for school, following the topic out of concern, or just curious about what the future might hold, the goal is to give you the full picture.</p>
            
            <p>Take your time exploring the pages of this site and forming your own informed opinion about one of the most fascinating and controversial scientific efforts of our time. The future of de-extinction, and possibly the future of life on this planet depends on the conversations happening right now.</p>
