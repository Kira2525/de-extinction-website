            <h2>The Extent of the Problem</h2>

            <h3>They Won't Be the Real Thing</h3>
            <p>With all these new advances in technology, there is always going to be a lot of risks and concerns because they are so new. One major concern is that any animal that scientists bring back will not be identical to the original species.</p>

            <div class="warning-box">
                <p>DNA becomes less like the original species over time and researchers can only work with whatever pieces that are still available, which means the revived animal may not be the exact same.</p>
            </div>

            <p>As a result, the recreated animal may have genetic gaps filled in with DNA from other species, making it just a little bit different. These recreated animals are really just "substitutes" for the original species and might not survive in modern ecosystems the same way real extinct animals once did.</p>

            <div class="image-placeholder">
                [Image: DNA strand illustration showing genetic gaps]
            </div>

            <h3>Health Problems Are Inevitable</h3>
            <p>Another issue is that de-extinct animals may suffer from serious health problems. If the animals are missing some important DNA and have genetic gaps, then this could lead to several issues:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Deformities that affect movement and survival</li>
                <li>Weak immune systems that can't fight diseases</li>
                <li>Developmental disorders that show up later in life</li>
                <li>Early aging like what happened with Dolly the sheep</li>
            </ul>

            <p>This means that even if the animal is successfully brought back, then it might not live a long and healthy life. The animal could suffer throughout its entire existence.</p>

            <div class="chart-placeholder">
                [Bar Graph: "Predicted Health Issues in De-Extinct Species" showing percentages of different health concerns]
            </div>

            <h3>The Environment Has Changed</h3>
            <p>Revived species could also disrupt existing ecosystems in ways that are unpredictable. Environments today are not the same as they were when the extinct animals originally lived. Several things have changed:</p>

            <div class="two-column">
                <div>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Climate change has altered temperatures</li>
                        <li>Habitat loss means less space</li>
                        <li>Food sources may no longer exist</li>
                        <li>Natural predators might be gone</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
                <div class="image-placeholder" style="height: 250px;">
                    [Image: Before and After - Ice Age vs Modern Arctic]
                </div>
            </div>

            <p>The de-extinct species may not have any predators, which could allow them to overpopulate. What if the new environments can't meet their needs like they once did? What if their food source is not around anymore? The species would go extinct again.</p>

            <h3>Who Owns Them? Who Protects Them?</h3>
            <p>Another huge concern is that the laws that we have right now do not cover de-extinct species. There are no rules that explain:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Who owns these animals</li>
                <li>How they would be protected</li>
                <li>Who is responsible if something goes wrong</li>
                <li>Whether they count as endangered species</li>
            </ul>

            <div class="highlight-box">
                <p>In 2017, a group of scientists and legal scholars published warnings that nomenclature and wildlife laws would need revisions to accommodate de-extinct species. Without these laws being updated, releasing these animals back into their habitat could be dangerous.</p>
            </div>

            <h3>The Money Problem</h3>
            <p>The cost of de-extinction is also a major concern. These projects require millions of dollars for everything that they do, including years of research, the technology, and a place to house them.</p>

            <div class="infographic-placeholder">
                [Infographic: "Where Should Conservation Money Go?" - Pie chart comparing de-extinction costs vs saving endangered species]
            </div>

            <p>Many people would prefer that money go to the animals that are at risk of becoming extinct right now. If funding is taken away from them then there will be more extinct animals by the time the project starts to actually work, and all their effort would be pointless. New technology is making de-extinction more possible, but it also raises some concerns about money and the effect that this could have on our environment.</p>

            <h3>What About Profit?</h3>
            <p>There is also the possibility that some companies might use revived species only to make money. Instead of focusing on science or conservation, businesses could turn de-extinct animals into attractions, products, or a way to advertise their business.</p>

            <p>This would take away the purpose of de-extinction and could lead to animals being mistreated. If profit becomes the main focus, then the animals and the environment will suffer.</p>
