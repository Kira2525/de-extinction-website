      <h1>Extent of the Problem</h1>

      <p>
        Even though de-extinction sounds exciting, the challenges behind it are serious and complex.
        Reviving extinct species is not as simple as copying DNA and bringing an animal back to life.
        Scientists face major biological, environmental, and legal problems that must be considered.
      </p>

      <p>
        One of the biggest challenges is incomplete or damaged DNA. Over time, DNA breaks down,
        meaning scientists often have to fill in missing genetic material using DNA from closely
        related species. As a result, revived animals would not be exact copies of the original species.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Missing or damaged genetic material</li>
        <li>Genetic gaps filled using DNA from other species</li>
        <li>Recreated animals are not exact replicas</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Health risks are another major concern. If important genetic information is missing, revived
        animals may suffer from deformities, weak immune systems, or developmental problems. Even if
        an animal survives birth, long-term health issues could shorten its lifespan or affect its
        quality of life.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>High risk of birth defects</li>
        <li>Weak immune systems</li>
        <li>Possible long-term health problems</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Modern ecosystems also present serious challenges. The environments that extinct animals once
        lived in no longer exist in the same way. Climate change, habitat loss, and changes in food
        sources could make survival difficult or impossible.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Climate and habitat conditions have changed</li>
        <li>Food sources may no longer exist</li>
        <li>Lack of predators could cause overpopulation</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        There are also legal and financial concerns. Current wildlife laws were created to protect
        endangered species, not animals brought back through genetic engineering. There are no clear
        rules that define who owns de-extinct animals or who is responsible if something goes wrong.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>No clear legal protections or ownership laws</li>
        <li>High costs requiring millions of dollars</li>
        <li>Funding may be taken away from endangered species</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Because of these challenges, scientists and policymakers must carefully consider whether
        de-extinction should move forward and how it can be done responsibly without causing further
        harm to animals or ecosystems.
      </p>
