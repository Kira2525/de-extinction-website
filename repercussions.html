      <h1>Ethical and Environmental Repercussions</h1>

      <p>
        De-extinction raises serious ethical and environmental concerns that go beyond the science itself.
        While bringing back extinct species may sound exciting, the long-term consequences could affect
        both the animals involved and the ecosystems they are introduced into.
      </p>

      <h3>Animal Welfare Concerns</h3>
      <p>
        One major concern is the potential suffering of revived animals. Because extinct species cannot
        be recreated perfectly, missing or altered DNA could result in genetic defects, weak immune
        systems, or developmental problems. Even if an animal survives birth, it may experience health
        issues throughout its life.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Animal suffering due to genetic defects</li>
        <li>Higher risk of illness and early death</li>
        <li>Uncertain quality of life for revived species</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Environmental Impact</h3>
      <p>
        Another major issue is how revived species might affect modern ecosystems. Environments today are
        very different from those that existed when many species went extinct. Climate change, habitat
        loss, and changes in food sources could prevent these animals from surviving naturally.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Potential ecosystem imbalance</li>
        <li>Lack of natural predators</li>
        <li>Risk of overpopulation or species collapse</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Ethical and Legal Concerns</h3>
      <p>
        De-extinction also raises ethical questions about whether humans should have the power to bring
        extinct species back at all. Some critics argue that scientists are “playing nature” and crossing
        moral boundaries. Others worry that current laws are not prepared to handle de-extinct species.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Legal and moral uncertainty</li>
        <li>No clear ownership or protection laws</li>
        <li>Unclear responsibility if something goes wrong</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Commercial Exploitation</h3>
      <p>
        There is also concern that de-extinct animals could be used for profit instead of conservation.
        Companies might turn revived species into attractions or marketing tools, which could lead to
        mistreatment and take focus away from environmental responsibility.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Commercial exploitation risks</li>
        <li>Profit prioritized over animal welfare</li>
        <li>Loss of scientific and conservation focus</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Because of these repercussions, many scientists and ethicists argue that de-extinction should only
        be pursued with extreme caution. Without strong ethical guidelines and legal protections, the risks
        may outweigh the potential benefits.
